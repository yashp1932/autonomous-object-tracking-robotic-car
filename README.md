# Autonomous Object-Tracking Robotic Car üöó\

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Summary**  

A dual-mode robotic car built on an **edge device (Raspberry Pi 4)** that can autonomously track objects or be manually driven via a **PS4 controller**. Implemented in **C++** using **OpenCV** for computer vision, **pigpio** for low-level PWM motor/servo control, and the **Linux joystick API** for input. Optimized for low-latency control (<50 ms) and reliable tracking accuracy (¬±3 px).
