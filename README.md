# Autonomous Object-Tracking Robotic Car 🚗

## ⚙️ **Summary**  

A dual-mode robotic car built on an **Raspberry Pi 4** that can autonomously track objects or be manually driven via a **PS4 controller**. Implemented in **C++** using **OpenCV** for computer vision, **pigpio** for low-level PWM motor/servo control, and the **Linux joystick API** for input. Optimized for low-latency control (<50 ms) and reliable tracking accuracy (±3 px).  

**Tech Stack:** C++ · OpenCV · pigpio · GStreamer · Linux Joystick API · Raspberry Pi 4 · TB6612FNG Motor Driver · Servo + DC Motors  

**Key Features:** Autonomous HSV-based object tracking · manual override via PS4 controller · low-latency camera + control loop · custom mechanical design
